(defn cache-get-or-fetch
  "Tiny helper for the usual 'fetch from cache, and if there's a miss, use fetch function to get the data but also cache it'
  Options:
    - `cache-get` - function to fetch from cache (usally redis), accepts 0 args
    - `fetch` - the function to fetch data from a slow resource, accepts 0 args
    - `cache-set` - the function to store data in cache, receives result of `fetch` as the only arg

  Note:
  You need to ensure that resuls of `fetch` and `cache-get` return the same types, e.g. Redis' `SET foo 1`
  will cast 1 as string on read!"
